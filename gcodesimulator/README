This software will display the GCode generated by RepRap host software
or other tools like skeinforge. The simulator is still beta and support
only displaying and rotating the object.
The green point is the point of origin of the object. The big red one
is the centre of the object. The camera will rotate around the red.

More features will come!

The example I placed in this archive is of the Wade's Extruder Project.
Thanks for this.
The G-Code file it self was build by predatorian (Alexander Wahlen) with
the skeinforge tool.

Thanks also to blablubtest as beta tester.

Compile instructions for Linux:
1) Open a terminal an go to the source folder
2) $ qmake -project -o RepRapGCodeSimulator.pro
3) Open the generated file RepRapGCodeSimulator.pro and add after
   INCLUDEPATH += .
   this:
   QT += opengl
4) $ qmake
5) $ make
6) Run the program with ./RepRap3DGCodeSimulator

Compile instructions for  Windows (Visual Studio):
1) Open a command window and go to the source folder
2) Type: qmake -project -t vcapp -o RepRapGCodeSimulator.pro
3) Open the generated file RepRapGCodeSimulator.pro and add after
   INCLUDEPATH += .
   this:
   QT += opengl
4) Type: qmake
5) Now you have a RepRapGCodeSimulator.vcproj which can be run by
   Visual Studio (2008 Pro in my case). Just compile it as Release
   or Debug and run it.
